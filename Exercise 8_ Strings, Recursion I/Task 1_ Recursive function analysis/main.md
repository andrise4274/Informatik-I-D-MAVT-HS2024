1. i) Pre- and post conditions
    ```c++
    // PRE: non negative integer
    // POST: returns 
    ```
    
    ii) The function `plain|f` terminates because as long the integer is not yet 0 (terminal condition), the function gets called again with n-1 -> so effectively n is decremented until n == 0 and false is returned
    
    iii) $\text{Calls}_{f}(n) = n + 1$


2. i) Pre- and post conditions
    ```c++
    // PRE:  integer >= 0
    // POST: prints n + 1 times '*' into the console 
    ```
    
    ii) The function `plain|g` terminates because ...
    
    iii)  $\text{Calls}_{g}(n) = ?$
